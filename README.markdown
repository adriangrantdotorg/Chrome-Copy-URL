# Copy URL+ (modified)

Copy URL+ is an extension for [Chrome][] that allows you to copy a URL (or short one) to your clipboard by using custom keyboard shortcuts. This is a forked version of the extension which makes the notification tooltip more prominent.

The original Copy URL+ is available on the [Chrome Web Store][].
